## Description

Taking its name from the French word meaning to eat or consume, Mangez is a Sinatra app that allows users to create recipes, plan meals, and generate a shopping list.

## Usage

To use this app, just clone the repository, run rake `db:migrate` and then run `shotgun`. Once the server is running, visit the location `shotgun` indicated on initialization, normally `localhost:[some port]`.

Once on the homepage simply log-in/sign-up to begin planning your meals. Bon appétit!
